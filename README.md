## Description

This will contain the rules and suggestions to properly flesh out the idea of creating a story playing a pokemon game. 

## Rules:

|Rule | Details | Notes |
|-----|---------|-------|
|1. Follow Base Nuzlocke Rules | [Base Nuzlocke rules](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Nuzlocke_Challenge#Basic_rules) |Try to make it easy if you are in to making a story|
|2. The protagonist is the starter | Always randomly pick your starter | Unless your favorite is in the list of 3 |
|3. The antagonist is the champion | The final fight after the elite four is what is considered the champion | In sun and moon that would mean Hau |
|4. Randomize Genre | [Genre](#genres) | I have a list of examples of which you can choose from or pick your own |
|5. Randomize [Tone](#tone) | How the story will play out, is it comedic, edgy, etc | List below |
|6. Protagonist death is allowed |  The run is still active after a replacement protagonist is chosen | examples of [methods](#protagonist-replacement) |
|7. Losing first Rival fight is not a reset | The first fight with the rival before pokeballs will count as a protagonist kill | First encounter after getting pokeballs becomes the new Protagonist |
|8. No Exp Share | Exp Share will be turned off if possible | self explanatory |
|9. Getting the Bad End | Bad end will happen when complete wipe has occurred | This only happens once pokeballs are given |
|10. No Masterballs | Masterballs are not allowed | We don't like deus x machinas here |
|11. No Revives | No using revives or any variation of it |  Protagonist may be revived if the replacement method calls for it |
|12. Prologue is written first | Write you're prologue once you have gotten your starter pokemon and pokeballs | This will set everything up in your story it should be done at the start |
|13. Write chapters after important events | The events are separated by important trainer fights in the game. | [List of common battles](#chapter-events) of events. |
|14. Write your ending after beating the champ | The ending is determined after defeating the antagonist | pretty self explanatory |
|15. Encounters | 1 per area but land and water count as separate encounters | you can technically get 1-2 encounters per area |


## RE:Zero Storylocke Ruleset
Similar to [Ultimate Ironmon](https://gist.github.com/valiant-code/adb18d248fa0fae7da6b639e2ee8f9c1) IronMon challenge with slight differences

Genre: Isekai
Tone: Comedy/Tragedy/

Differences:
| Rule | Details | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
|1. Only 6 pokemon | 1st encounter per area but you have to decide whether to kill it or catch it at that time | Once 6 pokemon are filled no switching |
|2. Subaru as your starter | Your starter has to be named Subaru and will be the decider if the game resets | He's the main character in RE: Zero duh |
|3. Reset Points | <li>Each gym counts as a reset point before the Elite four and the only time you can save.</li> <li>Use a save state before each gym as that will be reset point</li>| If Subaru dies in the gym fight you reset to an earlier point until full reset |
|4. Losing Party Members | After losing a party member, you can switch to Subaru and force a reset | You have to make the decision whether to save your friends or not |
|5. No Legendaries* | No legendaries with bst over 599+ | Just to keep it challenging |
|6. TMs | You can use TMs but with the caveat of using it right then and there with no knowledge of what it is. | You must decide if you will learn it right away and trash it if no pokemon can learn it |
|7. Randomizer Settings | Randomize everything | Since the whole goal is to actually right a story I'm forgoing some of the randomizer settings that make trainers harder. |
|8. Other Rules | Reference the official Ironmon rules first | For the most part follow the Ultimate Ironmon rules unless stated otherwise above |
|9. Writing the story | <li>Deaths are important and make sure to remember to write out the death scenes.</li> <li>You technically don't have to name your protagonist as Subaru but keep the genre/tone of RE:Zero</li> <li>Chapters should be based off of the Gyms as they are the reset points</li> | Have fun! |
