# Chapter 1

`Where am I?`

A dazed boy with black pig tails groggily gets up from the grass.

`This is... not the throne room...`

Clutching his head, the boy tries to recall what happened.

`I definitely died, betrayed, but how am I?...`

Looking at himself he can see that it wasn't his fully grown body. Then a splitting headache came as memories that did not belong to him start to bombard his brain.

The first memory was him training with his Psychish father, and learning Psycho Cut. Laughing after succesfully cutting a branch from a tree...

The next memory was him getting into a fight with a fellow classmate and finding out his inherented bloodline from his mother, Volatile Scales gave him the edge to win the fight...

Wincing another one started to play in his mind, using strong winds conjured by him to blind and push back a Darkian, giving him a chance to escape...

`This bodies name is Eugeneia... Eugene for short`

Looking at his body, he saw the scrapes from when he ran away from the Darkian boy. He remembered his soul seem to have merged with the boy and the once mighty Crimson Emperor is now inhabiting a new body.

`Thats right, Psychish race is naturally weak against Darkians. I couldn't do any damage to him, so I ran.`

He was just outside in the forest closest to the town where he resides. 

`Iki town... so I have started a new life. Well I should be thankful to Eugene. You are now a part of me and I will not forget. I will acheive your dream of becoming an adventurer, as it will be part of my plan to get my empire back.`

Eugene started walking towards the town gates with a bit of a limp, a black bruise on his throat from his earlier encounter. 

"Eugene?" Another boy with green hair calls out.

"Huh its Max." Eugene replies recognizing his school friend and rival.

"Jeez you look worse for wear. Did you get caught by the 2nd year?" Max curiously asks as he starts to help Eugene by placing his arm over his own shoulders.

"You could say something like that." With a foolish smile on his face, Eugene replied.

"Lets get you home, so you're dad can fix you up." Max stated before the two boys start heading to the Psychish boys house.

---------------

After getting to the house, his mother glared at him from the window as she looks back and then another figure exited the house. His father Kukui, sighed before placing his hands ontop of Eugene's head.

"Eugene, you're mother is going to get mad again. Probably bit off more than you can chew again... I taught you so you can defend yourself, not to get into fights with everyone who challenges you. I know you hate to lose but you should know your limits." Kukui sighed once more. 

"Father, you know me well enough already that I won't run unless I need to. That's why you should teach me some moves that work against Darkians." Eugene replied.

As they talked the bruise on his neck started to disappear.

"Well Mr. Bentson, thanks for healing him. You should stay close as I'm probably going to hurt him again." Max said with a smile.

As Eugene's friend and rival, they tend to spar with each other often.

"Well I guess I can be you're referee. I know you both want to become adventurers, but I don't get why you two cannot just work together. Why did you both to decide to make your own adventuring team is beyond me. But I guess being young you will be a bit headstrong." Kukui said while shaking his head.

"Of course they start fighting again when he just gets home." His mother chimes in from the side. "You do know you are only half Psychish and the other half is shapeshifter. Hence why you can get a bit more defense from other races. We still don't konw if how you look now will be what you look like when you're grown. As punishment your hair stay as pigtails until I say so."

"Yes mother... I'll accept this punishment." Needing to still act like a child and using the same tone as the original Eugene, he continued "Let's start Max!"

The two boys separated and gave each other room before getting into their battle stance. 

"Speed Swap!" Eugene started using his eyes to carefully match Max's movements.

"Haha I wore extra weights because I knew would do that!" Max taunts as he calls water around him to form a dragon like tail. "Aqua Tail!"

The tail of water was heavy as it hit Eugene square in the face. Causing him to be pushed back. `I'll have to swap back` he thought and quickly used Speed Swap again. This time not directly calling it out, which was a little out of character.

His father Kukui noticed that he didn't call out the move. `I guess he's started to get better` he mused, `Still he should have tested it out with an attack first to see who was faster.`

Getting the swap didn't save him from the second strike from the tail of water hitting him but he was lucky his body got use to it after the first hit and it didn't do a lot of damage the second time. Eugene was defiitely feeling he was running low on stamina, "Time to end this Max! Psycho Cut" forming a pink blade in the air. 

"I am ready for this too! Baneful Bunker" His green hair grew and protected his body from the strike, but now he was panting. A seven year olds stamina was still low for using moves like this. Then he started to get ready to drum on his belly but was quickly interrupted by another Psycho Cut from Eugene.

"Not fair!" Cried out Max.

Sticking out his tongue Eugene sent out another one. 

"Oh crud! Baneful Bunker!" Blocking another one of the strikes he kneeled on the ground exhausted. Then he saw another pink blade coming at him before being tipped over on his back.

"I lost again!" Max cried out lying on the ground.

"Phew that was close, you got trickier this time!" Eugene lied in the grass next to Max.

Kukui and his wife sighed at the two but then they noticed the grass being illuminated.

"Well I'll be a monkey's uncle. Looks like you've gained a new technique." Eugene's father started to say, "Looks like you have a bit of a healer in you after all. This allows you to mentally connect to grass and in return it will give you a bit of stamina back after a minute or so. Good for protecting a team."

"That's surprising, but you're grandfather always said we were descendents of a monarch in the past." His mother added.

`Interesting, Eugene we may be connected by blood. Which one was pregnant and didn't tell me? Most likely her... I see she must have survived after the fall. That's good, there may be others. I'll need a good team with me in order for me to create my empire again.`

A lot of the techniques they displayed today are from their family lineage. The Sun empire, in which they live in now, believed that all races should intermingle, to make a more united race. So interracial relationships were heavily advised, and some people believe that shapeshifters were one of the best to marry as they technically can turn into any race. 

"Well mom, I'm hungry... Max you staying for dinner?" Eugene whined before asking his friend.

"Yeah, I have to go or my mother will kill me. Looks like you have a new move to use to. I'll also get stronger just you wait!" As Max got up and started run to his own home, not forgetting to wave goodbye.

"Well lets go eat, dinner was ready before your little match here."

As the family of three went inside, Eugene smiled as now was a time of peace for him.
