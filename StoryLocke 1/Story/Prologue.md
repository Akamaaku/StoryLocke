# Prologue

Asteroth continent, a land with many long lived races, has prospered under the great Crimson Ruler. Under the Crimson empire, races were united and one's own opportunites were open as long as you strive to work for it. Truly a place of freedom and prosperity.

But with freedom comes choices, and some choices are not inherently in the good of the people. The Crimson Ruler held power that someone very close covetted. With that temptation and greed an inexcusable action was done. The Crimson Ruler was betrayed and regicide was committed.

A civil war between those who were loyal and those who wanted the power for their own purposes struck the land. After 10 years of constant battle, the loyal retainers of the Crimson Ruler lost. Most perished and others fled and hid for their safety. 

As for the Crimson Ruler, the anguish, hate, sadness, and above all the need for revenge propelled the ruler's soul into the future. Now waking up fifty years after the fall, is where our story begins.
