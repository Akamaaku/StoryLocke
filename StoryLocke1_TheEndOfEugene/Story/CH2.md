# Chapter 2

Its been 2 years and the two boys have grown from when they were young.

Eugene was speaking with a purple haired cat eared darkian named Varghese.

"I've gotten a lot better since the last time we fought." Remarked Eugene after finishing their sparring session.

His father Kukui watched the pair as he remembered when they first fought.

`Flashback`

"Eugene you need to be able to fight with Darkians, so I'm going to teach you Arm Thrust." Kukui began saying as he went into a stance. "The Warrions were the ones who developed this move for other races to learn to combat the Darkians in the age of turmoil."

`I should know, since I was the one who asked for it to be created.` Eugene nodded his head as he started to copy his father. 

As he was learning the move, a spectator came. Very similar to the boy who fought him before but quite a bit younger. "I'm sorry my brother attacked you Eugene."

"It's alright Varghese. The next time I meet him, I have a move specifically for him." Eugene replied to the younger boy.

"Really? That's cool, do you want to train together? I'll be joining the school next year!" Varghese inquired.

Kukui laughed a bit before saying, "Well I've heard from your father, he refuses to train you because you tricked a Warrion girl into a well."

"That was just a small prank! She wasn't suppose to fall into the well..." He said as his face turned red.

The other two males just looked at the impish rascal before continuing on with their training. With Eugene and Varghese getting ready to spar.

`End Flasback`

"Man it hurts! If you were truly a Warrion, you would probably knock me out extremely fast." Varghese complained. Being 2 years younger than Eugene he was considerably weaker.

"Oh right boys, I need some mushrooms and some herbs from the forest. Can you collect them for me?" Eugeneia's mother asked.

"We can get them! Man there are some crazy bugs in the forest. Right Eugene?" Varghese said agreeing to the request.

"Well since we are a party, lets go complete our quest!" Eugene smiled as the two boys went into the forest.

"Are you going to keep being a creep and staring at us from the bushes?" Kukui's wife asked.

Kukui was also staring at a bush just a bit further from the house. His face no longer showing the smile he had while talking to the two boys.

"It can't be?!" As the shadow left the bushes, Eugene's mother couldn't help but gasp.

---------------------------

Meanwhile both Eugene and Varghese was having a rough time as various venemous bugs kept interfering with their gathering. There was even a poisonous frog that was quickly dispatched by Eugene but not before it poisoned the both of them.

`Good thing we can find the antidote in this forest as well.` Eugene sighed as the both of them were chewing on very bitter tasting herbs.

As they continued to look for the mushrooms and the herbs they noticed the sun getting darker.

"That's weird it shouldn't be that long..." Varghese said seeing his shadow faintly disappearing. "Eugene look!"

Looking at the horizon the two boys noticed a massive amount of black smoke coming from the town. Enough smoke to actually shade them from the sun light.

"Lets hurry back! Something must have happened!" Eugene started running towards the town.

Varghese panting closely behind him.

As the two arrived they saw all the building were on fire and smoke blocked their eye sight.

"My house! Brother! Father! Mother!" Varghese screamed as he noticed three charred bodies in front of his home. Tears were already flowing as the grief hit him and he looked towards the only other person he considers as family.

"We have to find my parents as well Varghese!" Eugene began to panic. `What is going on! Iki town has always been a pretty peaceful town. There's no way bandits could have done this!`

The two found their way to Eugene's place and found the same burning aesthetic in front of them. The one difference though was another boy sitting down on what can be two charred bodies positioned into a grotesque chair.

"Psycho cut!" Eugene was the one who screamed this time as he shot pink blades at the green haired boy. The green haired boy didn't bat an eye as it hit him. 

"MAX! Why?! You are not this strong!" Varghese has now entered the fight. Feeling the utmost rage when seeing the other boy, he ran towards the boy as his teeth began to sharpen. Dodging a huge flame that would have burned him alive, he bit Max on the arm. Unfased as a bit of blood was seeping he threw fireball at the the young Darkian, which knocked him to the side.

"You shouldn't have fire! What's going on!" Eugene helped Varghese and placed him on the side as he was still unconcious and heavily burned.

"Hahahah" Max laughed before continuing, "You haven't figured it out yet have you. Come fight me and let me jog your memory!"

The two exchanged blows, Eugene unleashing as many Psycho cuts as he can while also maintaining his health with grassy terrain. Unfortunately it didn't seemed to be very effective as he was being hit by flames coming out of Max's arms and mouth. Which caused many third degree burns to char his dark skin.

Utilizing some of the healing herbs he found earlier he was able to alleviate some of the pain. He finally knocked down Max after a few more psycho cuts but something was off. 

`No I know this feeling, this is exactly what happened before I died` Eugene had a realization and exclaimed with fury, "AKA MAAKU!!!!!!!!!"

"Hahahahahahahhahahhahahahahahhahahahahahahahah" The body of max began to burn as fire engulfed him. "Finally! Did you think you were safe even after reincarnating?!" 

The body stood up but it was no longer the young boy. A taller figure with black tatoos adorned all over his red coloured skin, with black horns on his head, red wings on his back, and a huge menacing tail that looked like a hand looming behind him. "Oh the great Crimson Emperor, reduced to being a small child. Did you really think I wouldn't hunt you down. I read you're spell books and your research on reincarnation. It takes intense emotion to activate the spell, and I noticed it too late when I killed you the first time. But now I have found you again, time to finish what I started."

"DEMON!!!!!" Varghese yelled as he tried to give enough time for Eugene to recover some stamina. But his help was fruitless as his very punch to the demon's face didn't even warrant him a second look. Launched again by fire, he was again knocked out with barely any breath in his body.

"Varghese! I'll kill you AKA!" As Eugene in his fury threw arm thrust after arm thrust hoping to finish off his long time enemy.

As it seem to have a little bit of hope as the Demon Aka was being pushed back, the claw like tail started to turn into a spike before it thrusted through Eugene's heart. "This time no reincarnations. Pursuit!" 

A black aura enveloped Eugene's soul and quickly devoured him. "Delicious!" 

"EUGENE!" Throwing one last attempt of a sucker punch, the young Darkian boy fist flew but ultimately missed. Falling over, succumbing to the burns on his body.

"Hahahahahhahahahahahhahahahahaha"

The end..
