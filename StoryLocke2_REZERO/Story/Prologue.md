"Wakey wake, 103453"

I heard a voice as I slowly open my eyes.

"You don't need to worry about where you are."

The voice kept warping but couldn't find the exact location of it. As my eyes are starting to get use to the light, I feel like this is not something that should be regularly be found. There was a glowing orb in the center of the room. The color of the glow was very similar what you see when car oil mixes in water. 

"Not a bad way to explain chaotic aura. 103453... hmm don't like it. You mentioned car, so I shall call you Subaru."

That voice again, but this time it seem to come from above me.

Something pure and not yet affected by what you are incased in. You can call me a she if that makes you comfortable, but techinically I am an embodiment of chaos in this universe. Now I know what you will ask next... don't worry I'll explain that... just have a seat and I will explain."

A chair just formed underneath me and forced me to bend down and sit.
